BMI Calculator GUI Application
I developed this Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator as a GUI application using Python and the Tkinter library.

This project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface for inputting height and weight to calculate BMI and determine the corresponding WHO category. It includes essential features like error handling for invalid input and a visual BMI chart. A practical example of desktop application development with Python.
